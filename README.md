Before Running TMPWF-master.do

1. Change the root directory to where you want to save the outputs.
- I suggest using the Stata program FASTCD to assit in keeping track of root directories
2. TMPWF-master.do does the following
- Creates Folders for program if missing
- Copies 2 files from the internet
- Creates Stata *.dat files
- Creates output tables and graphs
- Creates *.rtf files
